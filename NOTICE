# Recall Jora-E

 ¯_(ツ)_/¯

[JORA-E](https://github.com/daxeh/jora-e-client) aimed at applying Flux concepts,
ImmutableJS as the app architecture basis. Similarly, this code challenge will highlight
a set of key feature demonstrating flexibility and adaptability by _applying feedback
given from previous code test_ in the following weighted order;

1.Implements Redux core concepts without ReduxJS with React hooks API.

2. React library features
    - Composing components with functional components and higher order components
    - Styling UI with Styled components
    - Hooks API  ie.useState, useContext
    - An usecase example for RxJS

3. ~~Testibility~~ (Unfortunately, due to time constraints and 3rd party library
dependency, testing was not a straight forward task that was push to last)

4. An initiative to use `redux-observable` but later dropped and the decision to
showcase only one example of a very simple usecase with `RxJS` library demonstrated
in component hook `usePatternMatcher`
